    The Impossible Mission Force (IMF) have received word of a Russian Airbus 400M taking off shortly from Minsk, Belarus with WMDs on board. The mission of three IMF members, Ethan Hunt, Luther Stickell, and Benjamin (Benji) Dunn, should they choose to accept it, is to prevent the aircraft from leaving with the WMDs, or the whole world will be at risk. As always, if any member of your team is caught or killed, the secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions. Do you accept your mission?
